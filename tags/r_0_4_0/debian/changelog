swath (0.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/watch: Added.
  * debian/copyright: Update source URL. Rewrite in machine-interpretable
    format.
  * Add Vcs-Cvs, Vcs-Browser and Homepage info.
  * New upstream release
    - Fix char signedness portability issues.
    - Improved messages and documentation.
  * Revise package description, to follow upstream docs.
  * debhelper compatibility level 5, and Build-dep on debhelper (>= 5.0.0).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3, no changes needed.
  * debian/rules adjustments:
    - Pass --host=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE) to configure only when cross compiling.
    - Do not force datadir to /usr/lib/swath; let's install dict data, which
      is arch-indep, under /usr/share as upstream does.
    - Do not ignore 'make distclean' errors.
    - Update config.guess and config.sub with autotools-dev, without including
      the changes in .diff.gz. Add Build-dep accordingly.
  * debian/docs: Install upstream README.
  * Fix CVSROOT in Vcs-Cvs, so it really works with debcheckout.
  * Build-dep on dpkg-dev (>= 1.14.13), for proper support of Vcs-Cvs field.
  * Corrections by Paul Wise's comments:
    + debian/control: Fix wording in package description.
    + debian/copyright: Don't refer to file in License field.
    + debian/rules:
      - Don't handle nostrip, as dh_strip already does.
      - Remove -j2 make option.
      - Pass CFLAGS to configure.
